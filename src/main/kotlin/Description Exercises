EXERCISE ONE
Letter combination Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in any order.
A mapping of digits to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below.
2(abc)
3(def)
4(ghi)
5(jkl)
6(mno)
7(pqrs)
8(tuv)
9(wxyz)

Example

Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]

EXERCISE TWO

You are given  two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list.

EXERCISE 3
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
